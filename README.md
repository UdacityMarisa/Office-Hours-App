(3) Implementation into Office Hours
<br>
	<p>
		(1) Process for Students:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li> 
				If students have a question: They will be directed to the web-app session upon entering office hours. There they can fill out the form to submit a question for the course managers to address. 
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				If students do not have a question: When there are no questions to address in the web-app the course coaches can address more general questions via chat/voice. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		(2) Process for Course Managers:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Coaches will start office hours and direct students to the app for question submission (either verbally or the link will be included in the office hours schedule directory). 
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				When opening the details to a question there will be a forum post to review. Go through the forum post and address the student on what they did well and what needs clarification in their forum post. Answer the question if it is able to be answered then or request a few changes and ask the student to submit the question with added info. Then move onto the next question. 
			</li>
		</ul>
